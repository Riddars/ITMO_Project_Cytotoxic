# ITMO_Project_Cytotoxic
Discovery of selectively cytotoxic inorganic nanoparticles using machine learning reinforced genetic algorithm 

Project aim:
Build a model that will predict whether a nanoparticle has selective toxicity to cancer cells.

Roadmap:
1) Download dataset
2) Add missing descriptors
3) Clean the dataset
   - [ ] remove unrepresentative information
   - [ ] normalization
   - [ ] Encoding
5) Data visualization (done between step 2 and 3 too)
6) Building regression models to predict the survival column
7) Optimization of the selected model
8) Feature importance

Participants:
1) Arsen Sarkisyan
2) Nam Evgeniy
3) Anna Delova
