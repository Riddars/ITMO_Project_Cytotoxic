# ITMO_Project_Cytotoxic
Discovery of selectively cytotoxic inorganic nanoparticles using machine learning reinforced genetic algorithm 

Project aim:
Build a model that will predict whether a nanoparticle has selective toxicity to cancer cells.

Roadmap:
1) Download dataset
2) Add missing descriptors
3) Clean the dataset
   - [X] remove unrepresentative information
   - [X] normalization
   - [X] Encoding
5) Data visualization (done between step 2 and 3 too)
6) Building regression models to predict the survival column
7) Optimization of the selected model
8) Feature importance

Participants:
1) Arsen Sarkisyan
2) Nam Evgeniy
3) Anna Delova

The names of the folders correspond to their purpose. The main branch contains the final versions of works from each branch, these versions are contained in the folders and are labeled "final".
You can familiarize yourself with the work process by navigating through the commits history or by going to one of the branches, not counting the main branch. These branches contain intermediate files and drafts.
Running the code:
1) download the "Final_programm.ipynb" file
2) open Google collab
3) In Google collab, click: file - open notepad - upload
4) Upload the downloaded file "Final_programm.ipynb"
5) Execute all the code in order by clicking: run environment - execute all
